# Embedding
  Embedding translates someting complex into something machine can work on.It represents important features of an input  
  object in a low dimensional compact format.This representation can be used as a ML feature and for diract comparisons.
## Work embeddings
  * SkipGram model
    - It learns the vector representation of each word that maximizes the probability of that word given the previous word
    - Embeddings are hidden layer weights from Skipgram model
## Graph embeddings
  * Deep walk
