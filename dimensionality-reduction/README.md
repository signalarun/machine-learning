## Dimensionality Reduction
  Scaling down large number of attributes to small number of attributes.It helps to deal with the curse of dimensionlality.
  
### Methods
+ Linear transformation
  - PCA
    * Helps to identify relationships and corelations among attributes
    * Get correlation or covariance matrix -> calculate eigen values and eigne vectors of the correlation or covariance matrix -> 
      PC = eigen values or eigen vector * Original data 
  - Linear discriminant analysis
  - Factor analysis
+ Non-linear transform
  - t-SNE
  - Hessian eigenmaps
  - Spectral embedding
  - Isometric feature mapping
