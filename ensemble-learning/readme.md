## Ensemble learning
 This combines the predictions from two or more models.


"Empirical and theoretical evidence show that some ensemble techniques (such as bagging) act as a variance reduction mechanism, i.e., they reduce the variance component of the error. Moreover, empirical results suggest that other ensemble techniques (such as AdaBoost) reduce both the bias and the variance parts of the error."
