# Multi-Class Neural Networks
  ## One Vs. All
    In this design each output node represent each class. It becomes inefficient as the number of classes rises.
  ## Softmax
    This design assigns decimal probabilities to each class in a multi-class problem, these probabilities also must add upto one.
    This constraint help training to converge more quickly than it otherwise would.Softmax assumes each datapoint is a member of 
    exactly one class.
