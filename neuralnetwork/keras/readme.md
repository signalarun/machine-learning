Typical Keras workflow looks like :
-----------------------------------
- Define your training data: input tensors and target tensors.
- Define a network of layers (or model) that maps your inputs to your targets.
- Configure the learning process by choosing a loss function, an optimizer, and some metrics to monitor.
- Iterate on your training data by calling the fit() method of your model.
