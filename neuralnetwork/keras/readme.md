Keras
-----
 Keras is a model-level library, providing high-level building blocks for developing deep-learning models. Currently, the three existing backend implementations are the TensorFlow backend, the Theano backend, and the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) backend.
 
Typical Keras workflow looks like :
-----------------------------------
- Define your training data: input tensors and target tensors.
- Define a network of layers (or model) that maps your inputs to your targets.
- Configure the learning process by choosing a loss function, an optimizer, and some metrics to monitor.
- Iterate on your training data by calling the fit() method of your model.
