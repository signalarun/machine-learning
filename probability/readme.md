## Probability of multiple random variable
* Joint probability : Probability of events A and B
* Marginal Probability : Probability of event X=A given variable Y
  - P(X=A) = sum P(X=A, Y=yi) for all y
* Conditional probability : Probability of event A given event B

## Probability distribution
* Joint probability distribution
  - Conditioning
    * Reduction
  - Renormalization
  - Marginalization
